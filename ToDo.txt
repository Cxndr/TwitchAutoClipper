# TODO: WHAT DO WE DO IF INTERNET CONNECTION BREAKS?
    - currently we keep recieving data but all streams go to no chat messages which fills up the trap with empty chats.
    when the internet comes back on it will trigger lots of clips because the averages are 0.

# TODO: MAKE LOGS REVERSED ORDER.
    - so the most recent log goes to the top of the file.
    - when writing the log, write it to line 1.

# TODO: CLEAN UP CLIPPING CRITERIA PROCESS.
    - Remove unnecessary variables that dont get used
    - Rethink process and implications after learning what is happening with pokelawls

# TODO: INVESTIGATE POKELAWLS OFFLINE CLIPPING
    - on 6th April 3am-6am we made a tonne of clips on Pokelawls channel whilst they were offline and chat was barely moving
    - why was chat reaching the Inc threshold? did this line up with what is in pokelawls chatlog,
        - if not then why was inc high enough to trigger clips?

# TODO: RENAME main.py TO run.py
    - more intuitive name, describes what it is much better.
    - how to implement this with github?
        - is it as simple as making change locally and git push-ing? or do we need to make changes to the repo?
