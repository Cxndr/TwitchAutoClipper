# TODO: Do we need a good way to stop our program?
    - running in an infinite while True loop seems like bad practice.
    - should probably be using a start and stop function somehow

# TODO: Why are we still clipping channels when offline? (knut, mizkif) Is ignore offline channels not working here?

# TODO: CAN WE AVOID RAIDS!?
    - Raids are rarely moments worth clipping and will clog up records with unnecessary clips.
    - We could detect raids through api?
    - if not could a much weaker option could be to detect chatbot messages, wouldn't be a great solution though as people
    use different bots and some may not use any bots at all.

# TODO: CAN WE AVOID CHANNEL INTROS?
    - everytime gappyv starts stram several "starting soon!" clips get triggered because people spam his chat on stream start.
    - also a problem with jonzherkas stream, massive intial hit of 9.4 increase.
    - is this just a problem with channels that have previously been online, gone offline and then come back online
    while the program was running? - has this already been fixed by initializing channel tracking variables when they
    go online or offline?
        - test it out, but this should be fixed by initializing as the trap length gets reset and then needs to be
        refilled until is reaches chat_count_trap_time which should avoid the big increase upon initially going online.

# TODO: CAN WE AVOID SUBSCRIPTION SPAM FROM BOTS LIKE STREAMELEMENTS?
    - If someone gift a lot of subs, this isn't generally a very clippable moment but if the streamer is using
    streamelements or a similar bot to print "xx just subscribed.", this will trigger clips.
    - What other bots do we need to look for?
    SOLUTION: New System to exclude specific usernames from chat.


# TODO: WHAT DO WE DO IF INTERNET CONNECTION BREAKS?
    - currently we keep recieving data but all streams go to no chat messages which fills up the trap with empty chats.
    when the internet comes back on it will trigger lots of clips because the averages are 0.

# TODO: WHAT DO WE DO IF OUR LOG FILES OR CLIPS.CSV BECOMES TOO BIG TO OPEN?
    - if the program is designed to run 24/7 then can we implement some level of automatic cleanup?
        - Consider reducing the amount of logging we are doing by default. Add a specific mode to log full chat.
            - chat.log is mostly unnessecary (except for some debugging scenarios), as we store individual chats seperately.
            - clips.log is duplicating a lot of the role of clip.csv. We could move important debugging data to clips.csv
            or merge into main.log?
        - Can we auto delete log lines after a certain length of time or file size?
            - control this from settings or a debug mode?

# TODO: CLEAN UP CLIPPING CRITERIA PROCESS.
    - Remove unnecessary variables that dont get used
    - Rethink process and implications after learning what is happening with pokelawls

# TODO: RENAME main.py TO run.py
    - more intuitive name, describes what it is much better.
    - how to implement this with github?
        - is it as simple as making change locally and git push-ing? or do we need to make changes to the repo?
        - i think pycharm will manage this for us, but should learn how to accomplish manually.

# TODO: Why does imreallyimportant channel spam random clips even with very low chat activity?
    - problem seems to be worse the more channels we are tracking - because it extends the tick length?
    - Next see if it gets better at faster tick rate? or worse at very slow tick rate.

# TO#DO: INVESTIGATE POKELAWLS OFFLINE CLIPPING
    - on 6th April 3am-6am we made a tonne of clips on Pokelawls channel whilst they were offline and chat was barely moving
    - why was chat reaching the Inc threshold? did this line up with what is in pokelawls chatlog,
        - if not then why was inc high enough to trigger clips?

Investigated pokelawls offline clipping. Pokelawls had a relatively active offline chat this night.

# TO#DO: MAKE LOGS REVERSED ORDER.
    - so the most recent log goes to the top of the file.
    - when writing the log, write it to line 1.

It's very inneficient to write to the start of the file for every log. Computationally we'd have to navigate to start of file every time.
OS's are designed to make appends (to end of file) very fast and efficient. With the amount of logging we are doing this would be a bad idea.
Better to just reverse the order when opening the file and make sure we aren't making huge file logs.
