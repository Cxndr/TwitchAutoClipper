2022-04-05 02:47:31,986 - chat_count:4 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] @TheyCallMeTaj You'd think if we agree a masters in teaching is that valuable, we would pay teachers to study and acquire it
2022-04-05 02:47:39,447 - chat_count:5 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] Republicans hate a strong FLOTUS
2022-04-05 02:47:51,802 - chat_count:6 [imreallyimportant] [acreal] i would love to hear haz explain the mass graves

2022-04-05 02:48:21,535 - chat_count:8 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] @panda_worries right, that’s the part I’m not getting. Who is really benefiting from it?
2022-04-05 02:48:22,914 - chat_count:9 [imreallyimportant] [ReplayAttacks] @ms_monet that was def the "sin" she was never forgiven for by the GOP... not being "just a wife" god forbid an intelligent independent woman
2022-04-05 02:48:29,132 - chat_count:10 [imreallyimportant] [acreal] @DJQuad yeah no kidding

2022-04-05 02:49:16,669 - chat_count:14 [imreallyimportant] [ReplayAttacks] I'm old enough to remember the GOP pearl clutching at hillary in the 90s for having the audacity to speak at all lol
2022-04-05 02:49:37,368 - chat_count:15 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] if I were to be killed as a civilian in a war like this, I would want the world to witness that for me, in honesty
2022-04-05 02:49:47,646 - chat_count:16 [imreallyimportant] [metalgamer1186] reinforcing Dombas which they shouldve done in the first place...
2022-04-05 02:49:52,160 - chat_count:17 [imreallyimportant] [Musical_Tanks] yeah day 1 they had a massive airborne assault on it
2022-04-05 02:50:00,529 - chat_count:18 [imreallyimportant] [just_bizz] can they really drive tank from kyiv all the way to the east- iy doesnt make sense- wouldnt they go back to belarus?
2022-04-05 02:50:03,151 - chat_count:19 [imreallyimportant] [metalgamer1186] attacking Kyiv with the forces they have wouldve been suicide
2022-04-05 02:50:14,557 - chat_count:20 [imreallyimportant] [ms_monet] @replayattacks I would go as far as saying that being a parent intelligent independent woman is what sealed her fate of being quite possible one of the most unpopular politicians
2022-04-05 02:50:25,719 - chat_count:21 [imreallyimportant] [metalgamer1186] it took the us total air dominance, 100k troops and 1 month to take Fallujah
2022-04-05 02:50:32,574 - chat_count:22 [imreallyimportant] [ReplayAttacks] @ms_monet agree 100%
2022-04-05 02:50:42,022 - chat_count:23 [imreallyimportant] [ms_monet] Don’t know where the parent came from…damn autocorrect
2022-04-05 02:50:53,990 - chat_count:24 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] Certainly it marked her as a political threat that needed to be neutralized
2022-04-05 02:51:10,850 - chat_count:25 [imreallyimportant] [Musical_Tanks] Leningrad?
2022-04-05 02:51:12,292 - chat_count:26 [imreallyimportant] [metalgamer1186] they shouldve went after Odessa first than Kyiv, thank god they are so stupid OMEGALUL
2022-04-05 02:51:37,016 - chat_count:27 [imreallyimportant] [MeatHead213] I don't necessarily disagree with this
2022-04-05 02:51:50,837 - chat_count:28 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] yeah
2022-04-05 02:52:05,705 - chat_count:29 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] @ReplayAttacks The attacks she received (constantly) which were outrageous made her more "careful" and she had some bad advisors. She talked about this at length in recent interviews. Even when she did speak her mind (Basket of deplorables) and was right, the "liberal media" went absolutely crazy attacking her
2022-04-05 02:52:38,268 - chat_count:30 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] @metalgamer1186 They seemed to think they'd be able to move right down to Odessa
2022-04-05 02:52:46,274 - chat_count:31 [imreallyimportant] [MikeSci] razing a city imparts a severe warmonger penalty
2022-04-05 02:52:55,008 - chat_count:32 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] is the UN going to actually do anything?
2022-04-05 02:53:08,994 - chat_count:33 [imreallyimportant] [acreal] time for ukraine to invade and take russia
2022-04-05 02:53:10,556 - chat_count:34 [imreallyimportant] [dankprole] bulgaria below romania right?
2022-04-05 02:53:10,562 - chat_count:35 [imreallyimportant] [metalgamer1186] @DJQuad nothing now

2022-04-05 02:53:45,543 - chat_count:38 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] Anyone old enough to remember when he ran for Pres in 2004 primaries? Raise your hand
2022-04-05 02:53:55,204 - chat_count:39 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] @panda_worries I thought about that with the family that was killed leaving Irpin. The New York Times put the picture on the front page. I wondered if people found out by seeing their bodies on the front page. But I think I would want the world to know if meant it saved others
2022-04-05 02:55:03,318 - chat_count:40 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] Sadge looks like I'm the only one here who was paying attention in 2004 Democratic primary to remember Gen. Clark running against John Kerry, John Edwards, Howard Dean Sadge
2022-04-05 02:55:18,357 - chat_count:41 [imreallyimportant] [Musical_Tanks] monkaS
2022-04-05 02:55:22,651 - chat_count:42 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] @TheyCallMeTaj I wouldn't want to be a forgotten and anonymous casualty of non specific cause - would want people to know exactly what kind of war crime horror befell me and mine if I were so unfortunate
2022-04-05 02:55:37,508 - chat_count:43 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] Initially Russia thought they could take Ukraine up to the river and hold it...
2022-04-05 02:55:41,260 - chat_count:44 [imreallyimportant] [F_U_B_A_R_] What he is saying, This is being watched from both sides, just pointess giving out battle plans.
2022-04-05 02:55:50,113 - chat_count:45 [imreallyimportant] [ms_monet] I remember….the John Edwards drama kinda took over for a hot minute
2022-04-05 02:55:53,910 - chat_count:46 [imreallyimportant] [Vetack_vs_The_World] Ukraine needs MBTs basically. Main Battle Tanks is what hes saying
2022-04-05 02:56:12,667 - chat_count:47 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] it's nice to see his expertise on CNN
2022-04-05 02:56:19,283 - chat_count:48 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] i remember howard dean yelling
2022-04-05 02:56:21,988 - chat_count:49 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] @mahcahwaca I was supporting John Edwards in that primary. We know how that turned out FeelsBadMan
2022-04-05 02:56:27,831 - chat_count:50 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] @panda_worries right. I can only imagine for everyone that we know about, how many we don’t.
2022-04-05 02:56:31,975 - chat_count:51 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] yeah me too @panda_worries I got fooled by Edwards twice Sadge
2022-04-05 02:57:15,962 - chat_count:52 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] all the while Trump b*tches about losing, btw
2022-04-05 02:57:20,317 - chat_count:53 [imreallyimportant] [ms_monet] I voted for Kerry in that primary
2022-04-05 02:57:39,882 - chat_count:54 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] pbs is usually pretty tame as far as dead bodies

2022-04-05 02:59:18,938 - chat_count:61 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] @mahcahwaca How one manages to not only betray their spouse - but a whole network of supporters who were counting on them, heh

2022-04-05 02:59:34,211 - chat_count:63 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] It's important. And PBS is not gratuitous.
2022-04-05 02:59:38,614 - chat_count:64 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] don't show it, we can all watch it elsewhere if we want
2022-04-05 02:59:42,247 - chat_count:65 [imreallyimportant] [CooYaMayaStupa] its not your choice man dont feel bad
2022-04-05 02:59:54,341 - chat_count:66 [imreallyimportant] [Dumpy_Gaming] pbs is basic airwaves right?

2022-04-05 03:00:16,425 - chat_count:70 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] they don't get graphic. but don't risk your channel on my opinion
2022-04-05 03:00:17,373 - chat_count:71 [imreallyimportant] [IvannaBeSpanked] 420 nice
2022-04-05 03:00:40,844 - chat_count:72 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] I think most of us have also seen it already, so we can fill in the blanks
2022-04-05 03:00:52,858 - chat_count:73 [imreallyimportant] [imreallyimportant] https://youtu.be/392rMVFFME4?t=230
2022-04-05 03:01:13,600 - chat_count:74 [imreallyimportant] [abondv4_20] thx
2022-04-05 03:02:10,843 - chat_count:75 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] I think *seeing* the victims lying there with their hands still bound is a powerful indictment
2022-04-05 03:02:23,002 - chat_count:76 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] I live in a suburb of NYC and I pictured this driving home tonight
2022-04-05 03:02:27,295 - chat_count:77 [imreallyimportant] [Johnny_Appledick] @imreallyimportant did you read the ny times article that checked satellity imagery. apparently they did this a while ago.
2022-04-05 03:02:51,884 - chat_count:78 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] I read that the Russians had something like 45,000  body bags sent to Kyiv
2022-04-05 03:02:55,875 - chat_count:79 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] @Johnny_Appledick withing the last week or so
2022-04-05 03:02:56,886 - chat_count:80 [imreallyimportant] [Johnny_Appledick] it's pretty damning evidence
2022-04-05 03:03:15,771 - chat_count:81 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] I think about the families more than anything else. Them having to see their family members deceased
2022-04-05 03:03:20,431 - chat_count:82 [imreallyimportant] [abondv4_20] yea Twictch can'  handle these pics, but a pic is worth a thousand words
2022-04-05 03:03:31,953 - chat_count:83 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] @abondv4_20 right
2022-04-05 03:03:52,026 - chat_count:84 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] @Johnny_Appledick I read that the variety of stages the bodies were in indicated ongoing killing over time rather than one incident
2022-04-05 03:03:58,664 - chat_count:85 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] It's fine with me that Twitch doesn't allow this, it's readily available on all other platforms
2022-04-05 03:04:15,125 - chat_count:86 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] Yeah that doesn’t make sense
2022-04-05 03:04:16,639 - chat_count:87 [imreallyimportant] [Johnny_Appledick] @panda_worries yeah it's horrific
2022-04-05 03:04:26,996 - chat_count:88 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] Jesus Christ
2022-04-05 03:04:42,933 - chat_count:89 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] the only thing twitch platforms is russian apologists
2022-04-05 03:04:47,554 - chat_count:90 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] Flipping monsters
2022-04-05 03:04:59,476 - chat_count:91 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] @djquad Seriously
2022-04-05 03:05:19,332 - chat_count:92 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] the butt on that guy's face is a bit distracting. Because even with the  grim seriousness of the subject, my inner 10yr old never dies.
2022-04-05 03:05:30,018 - chat_count:93 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] I find myself asking what would make people do that?
2022-04-05 03:05:43,127 - chat_count:94 [imreallyimportant] [KizamaruTheDK] More and more I care less and less for the Russian forces.
2022-04-05 03:05:52,102 - chat_count:95 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] Poor woman

2022-04-05 03:05:54,225 - chat_count:97 [imreallyimportant] [t0pfuel] I wonder how much it will take for Nato to step in
2022-04-05 03:06:03,946 - chat_count:98 [imreallyimportant] [stoic_squirrel] The Russians are no different from Nazis now
2022-04-05 03:06:05,261 - chat_count:99 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] And they were telling people there they were liberating them from Nazis - crazy
2022-04-05 03:06:10,496 - chat_count:100 [imreallyimportant] [trymymilk69] How can Russia not care one bit about how evil they are?
2022-04-05 03:06:17,022 - chat_count:101 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] @t0pfuel They won’t
2022-04-05 03:06:18,919 - chat_count:102 [imreallyimportant] [AstroLykos] This reporter Simon Ostrovsky is one of my favorites he is brave
2022-04-05 03:06:25,547 - chat_count:103 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] i think most of it is just propaganda
2022-04-05 03:06:26,108 - chat_count:104 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] this could be any town, anywhere in the world
2022-04-05 03:06:28,935 - chat_count:105 [imreallyimportant] [Econoboi] Hey IRI, hope all is well
2022-04-05 03:06:46,654 - chat_count:106 [imreallyimportant] [abondv4_20] Russia like s to hide reality with stories and lies but aint nowhere to hide from this
2022-04-05 03:07:01,253 - chat_count:107 [imreallyimportant] [AstroLykos] Simon was kidnapped and beaten by Russians in 2014
2022-04-05 03:07:04,074 - chat_count:108 [imreallyimportant] [alcw221] They aren’t planning to declare peace. They will kill everyone sadly
2022-04-05 03:07:23,389 - chat_count:109 [imreallyimportant] [Vetack_vs_The_World] @stoic_squirrel Horribly ironic is that Putin has that Wagner mercenary group going in now and those mercs in that company are all self declared Nazis. Not sure how Putin squares that one
2022-04-05 03:07:24,898 - chat_count:110 [imreallyimportant] [Johnny_Appledick] imagine signing a peace treaty with russia and just allowing this to happen to the rest of your citizens.
2022-04-05 03:07:34,226 - chat_count:111 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] No doubt this has happened before in history, in other wars, but  I think the technology makes it impossible NOT to see
2022-04-05 03:07:40,571 - chat_count:112 [imreallyimportant] [Vayelise] didn't Putin say back in 2014 that this invasion would happen if they conflict didn't stop?
2022-04-05 03:07:58,807 - chat_count:113 [imreallyimportant] [fruhkartoffeln] Dehumanization of the 'enemy', excessive military culture, and blaming outsiders for internally created problems. Putin is doing what Japan and Germany did prior to WW2
2022-04-05 03:08:02,137 - chat_count:114 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] No one is letting this slide in Europe. Europe remembers WWII
2022-04-05 03:08:03,887 - chat_count:115 [imreallyimportant] [AstroLykos] It seems obvious to me it matches the dictionary definition of genocide
2022-04-05 03:08:08,727 - chat_count:116 [imreallyimportant] [alcw221] If you talk to Swedes and Finns, the Russians have invaded for last several hundred years and killed and enslaved the population
2022-04-05 03:08:10,326 - chat_count:117 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] That's really why it gets more attention than say, the horrors in Yemen. This looks like where we live and how we live. And a small number of weeks ago, their lives and towns looked like ours
2022-04-05 03:08:22,689 - chat_count:118 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] that’s horrible. I hope her being able to tell his story brings a little comfort
2022-04-05 03:08:23,125 - chat_count:119 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] i'm getting more upset by nato by the day
2022-04-05 03:08:29,306 - chat_count:120 [imreallyimportant] [IvannaBeSpanked] Ukrainians are heros
2022-04-05 03:08:36,938 - chat_count:121 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] @panda_worries right
2022-04-05 03:08:37,059 - chat_count:122 [imreallyimportant] [t0pfuel] Oh it does, believe me, I will never forgive this
2022-04-05 03:08:45,830 - chat_count:123 [imreallyimportant] [ReplayAttacks] putin has been planting the seeds of justification with nonsense to mask his real goal which is energy dominance for the european market
2022-04-05 03:08:46,846 - chat_count:124 [imreallyimportant] [pababoy] Russia standing up to American Imperialism by gunning down innocent civilians
2022-04-05 03:08:47,850 - chat_count:125 [imreallyimportant] [trymymilk69] @djquad is NATO killing civilions? you Russian shill
2022-04-05 03:08:49,294 - chat_count:126 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] @vayelise Putin kept the conflict going in the from the get
2022-04-05 03:08:53,501 - chat_count:127 [imreallyimportant] [alcw221] Europeans are concerned . They have been brutalized by Russia before
2022-04-05 03:09:11,602 - chat_count:128 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] He have cared
2022-04-05 03:09:14,941 - chat_count:129 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] We**
2022-04-05 03:09:34,489 - chat_count:130 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] The unfortunate truth
2022-04-05 03:09:41,562 - chat_count:131 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] Listen the their National Anthems, les Marseillais, for example
2022-04-05 03:09:51,740 - chat_count:132 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] @trymymilk69 um what? nato isn't doing enough to stop them imo
2022-04-05 03:10:04,405 - chat_count:133 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] that was the one Wasted was arguing with earlier lol
2022-04-05 03:10:10,155 - chat_count:134 [imreallyimportant] [sighdonia] imreallyBanned good riddance
2022-04-05 03:10:12,193 - chat_count:135 [imreallyimportant] [alcw221] There are large nat gas reserves in ukraine . Russia wants them
2022-04-05 03:10:15,906 - chat_count:136 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] There was coverage of Yemen. There have been protests for that and plenty of people have been outspoken about Israel/Palestine
2022-04-05 03:10:40,779 - chat_count:137 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] We can’t pretend that was all over the news
2022-04-05 03:10:43,295 - chat_count:138 [imreallyimportant] [Misbashful] I don't know how they would come to any kind of peace deal with the Russians. Their word means nothing.
2022-04-05 03:10:44,389 - chat_count:139 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] This situation has made me more aware of my own ignorance to other recent events
2022-04-05 03:10:44,878 - chat_count:140 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] Don't feed the trolls, highlight misbehavior to the mods, yeah
2022-04-05 03:11:01,502 - chat_count:141 [imreallyimportant] [ReplayAttacks] @alcw221 this, specifically, they don't want the competition... almost the entire russian GDP is oil and gas
2022-04-05 03:11:13,822 - chat_count:142 [imreallyimportant] [trymymilk69] @djquad I apologize I misunderstood
2022-04-05 03:11:17,152 - chat_count:143 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] @misbashful yeah I not sure how the6 can trust them
2022-04-05 03:11:21,007 - chat_count:144 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] @TheyCallMeTaj It's truly humbling, isn't it
2022-04-05 03:11:54,827 - chat_count:145 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] @trymymilk69 no worries :)
2022-04-05 03:12:04,958 - chat_count:146 [imreallyimportant] [Johnny_Appledick] first responders <3
2022-04-05 03:12:08,203 - chat_count:147 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] @theycallmetaj Makes the whole comment of “I’m not political” pretty inexcusable now huh?
2022-04-05 03:12:32,324 - chat_count:148 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I’ve been asking how in the heck are the first responders doing this…responding while in a war zone.  First I’ve seen any thing mention them
2022-04-05 03:12:38,958 - chat_count:149 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] If I were a Ukranian, I would want to stay and fight. And yet, I'd move mountains to get my teen son out. How hard is it to be a mother there right now?
2022-04-05 03:12:39,603 - chat_count:150 [imreallyimportant] [abondv4_20] wow, jueat fearless
2022-04-05 03:13:03,480 - chat_count:151 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] @TheyCallMeTaj The have either enlisted or been conscripted
2022-04-05 03:13:27,649 - chat_count:152 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] @panda_worries No kidding. Mine is 5 and I can’t get my head out of the bunkers with the kids. I just can’t
2022-04-05 03:13:39,845 - chat_count:153 [imreallyimportant] [hpnotiq115] Def feel like Russia is trying to destroy as much of it as they can since conquering Ukraine has become harder than they thought
2022-04-05 03:14:09,738 - chat_count:154 [imreallyimportant] [Vetack_vs_The_World] Its indiscriminate shelling too
2022-04-05 03:14:12,061 - chat_count:155 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] @neurotikka it makes you really think. I have to be more responsible about knowing about events, not waiting until others decide it’s important to show
2022-04-05 03:14:15,852 - chat_count:156 [imreallyimportant] [fruhkartoffeln] What scholars have said today, this is genocide.
2022-04-05 03:14:18,303 - chat_count:157 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] @hpnotiq115 Bingo. Then they just rebulid it how they want
2022-04-05 03:14:18,697 - chat_count:158 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] targeting nazis btw. like wtf
2022-04-05 03:14:23,014 - chat_count:159 [imreallyimportant] [t0pfuel] @hpnotiq115 putin did say if he can't have Ukraine, nobody can.
2022-04-05 03:14:27,384 - chat_count:160 [imreallyimportant] [otooletime] crazy
2022-04-05 03:14:36,960 - chat_count:161 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] What’s laying in the opening going to do?
2022-04-05 03:14:51,729 - chat_count:162 [imreallyimportant] [sighdonia] @TheyCallMeTaj avoid shrapnel
2022-04-05 03:14:51,891 - chat_count:163 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] @t0pfuel I don’t think he said that specifically
2022-04-05 03:14:54,416 - chat_count:164 [imreallyimportant] [phantom13h] TheyCallMeTaj less area for shrapnel
2022-04-05 03:14:58,005 - chat_count:165 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] @TheyCallMeTaj not a thing
2022-04-05 03:15:17,162 - chat_count:166 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] @Neurotikka And of course, his dad would have to stay, and I'd want to stay with him - but who else would protect and move your children?
2022-04-05 03:15:18,013 - chat_count:167 [imreallyimportant] [Neurotikka] @theycallmetaj Also to avoid being thrown
2022-04-05 03:15:18,601 - chat_count:168 [imreallyimportant] [Vetack_vs_The_World] Artillery hits and then explodes upwards. Laying on the ground you could still potentially survive a "close" hit.
2022-04-05 03:15:20,909 - chat_count:169 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] Oh okay. I literally have no concept
2022-04-05 03:15:28,968 - chat_count:170 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] @TheyCallMeTaj I guess rubble won't fall on you so that's a plus
2022-04-05 03:15:51,643 - chat_count:171 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] I wouldn’t last a day

2022-04-05 03:16:05,002 - chat_count:175 [imreallyimportant] [Vetack_vs_The_World] Caught in the open its really the only way to avoid some shrapnel so you hit the deck
2022-04-05 03:16:07,041 - chat_count:176 [imreallyimportant] [ReplayAttacks] heartbreaking
2022-04-05 03:16:33,423 - chat_count:177 [imreallyimportant] [DJQuad] TheyCallMeTaj probably an instinct after a big f'n bomb right next to you
2022-04-05 03:16:41,228 - chat_count:178 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] Well that’s good info to know, hopefully I never have to use it.
2022-04-05 03:16:53,614 - chat_count:179 [imreallyimportant] [hpnotiq115] didn't someone report that Russia is trying to relocate to some of Ukraines product rich land? I wonder if they plan on destroying the land so that Ukraine can't use it in the future for crops and products
2022-04-05 03:17:11,222 - chat_count:180 [imreallyimportant] [Misbashful] Is there any way to remove Russia from the Security Council?
2022-04-05 03:17:26,907 - chat_count:181 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] I think I would hit the deck no matter what as instinct
2022-04-05 03:17:28,252 - chat_count:182 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] Good question
2022-04-05 03:17:33,050 - chat_count:183 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] That's a cabinet
2022-04-05 03:17:33,658 - chat_count:184 [imreallyimportant] [ReplayAttacks] the wall i think
2022-04-05 03:17:36,686 - chat_count:185 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] It's spring... I wonder how planting in Ukraine is carrying on?
2022-04-05 03:17:44,115 - chat_count:186 [imreallyimportant] [stoic_squirrel] It’s an old gamer chair
2022-04-05 03:17:44,171 - chat_count:187 [imreallyimportant] [MikeSci] that's a cabi-chair, unique to british universities
2022-04-05 03:17:47,040 - chat_count:188 [imreallyimportant] [JustForGrins_] that looks like a wooden plaque or something
2022-04-05 03:17:47,045 - chat_count:189 [imreallyimportant] [Vetack_vs_The_World] Cabinet. I think theres candles on it
2022-04-05 03:17:51,793 - chat_count:190 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] The UN can expel Russia but I doubt they will
2022-04-05 03:17:52,044 - chat_count:191 [imreallyimportant] [agent_seventyone] i hope its his chair
2022-04-05 03:17:53,388 - chat_count:192 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] Looks uncomfortable

2022-04-05 03:18:18,271 - chat_count:199 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] Maybe a chair in front and you can’t see the back

2022-04-05 03:25:33,284 - chat_count:241 [imreallyimportant] [ninja_of_physics] i like how they ended it
2022-04-05 03:25:35,585 - chat_count:242 [imreallyimportant] [Follidus] They ended by only allowing you to put white pixels on

2022-04-05 03:25:44,664 - chat_count:244 [imreallyimportant] [dankprole] they wiped it
2022-04-05 03:25:46,409 - chat_count:245 [imreallyimportant] [ratchetbug] It's just a white canvas now
2022-04-05 03:25:47,701 - chat_count:246 [imreallyimportant] [Laekuk] For the last hour you could only place white pixels

2022-04-05 03:25:50,703 - chat_count:248 [imreallyimportant] [sighdonia] they changed it so you could only place white pixels
2022-04-05 03:25:54,717 - chat_count:249 [imreallyimportant] [sighdonia] so it went away
2022-04-05 03:25:57,883 - chat_count:250 [imreallyimportant] [ninja_of_physics] @imreallyimportant they made it so you would only put white pixles down
2022-04-05 03:26:14,453 - chat_count:251 [imreallyimportant] [DD_The_Shmey] @imreallyimportant the bots destroyed everything

2022-04-05 03:26:21,026 - chat_count:253 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] I can only imagine - seeing your countrymen executed in the streets, with the pressure that you're the one they're looking to for guidance. So overwhelming. @ratchetbug

2022-04-05 04:09:53,855 - chat_count:779 [imreallyimportant] [stoic_squirrel] The problem is housing is too spread out. Zoning laws are terrible
2022-04-05 04:09:59,392 - chat_count:780 [imreallyimportant] [weavdaddy101] i wonder if she would welcome climate legislation
2022-04-05 04:10:00,086 - chat_count:781 [imreallyimportant] [TheyCallMeTaj] I feel most of California is unoccupied
2022-04-05 04:10:03,398 - chat_count:782 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] It's almost not affordable to rent
2022-04-05 04:10:07,356 - chat_count:783 [imreallyimportant] [couchman1111] @shadimar I thought you asked geographically what’s at the top of the map
2022-04-05 04:10:10,702 - chat_count:784 [imreallyimportant] [dankprole] The European Union's population density  is 300 persons per square mile (only 7 out of 50 US states are above this) whereas the US's population density is 81 persons per square mile (only 4 out of 28 EU states are below this)

2022-04-05 04:10:58,633 - chat_count:793 [imreallyimportant] [panda_worries] Well, many many people live in the desert of southern Cali, and THAT certainly causes water problems in that locale LUL @TheyCallMeTaj
2022-04-05 04:11:02,590 - chat_count:794 [imreallyimportant] [otooletime] Lack of multifamily housing and zoning laws that restrict shops from being co located with residents is a problem

2022-04-05 04:12:03,854 - chat_count:803 [imreallyimportant] [dbpsychlops] Socialism is based capitalism though
2022-04-05 04:12:06,419 - chat_count:804 [imreallyimportant] [stoic_squirrel] I can’t believe I’m saying this but too much regulation (in the form of zoning laws) caused the housing crisis
2022-04-05 04:12:12,676 - chat_count:805 [imreallyimportant] [couchman1111] Capitalism with more social programs is what I want. Not full socialism

2022-04-05 04:12:34,158 - chat_count:807 [imreallyimportant] [dankprole] I agree but I think you need some people pushing the extreme position so that people don't compromise on the compromise
2022-04-05 04:12:34,189 - chat_count:808 [imreallyimportant] [Shadimar] @couchman1111 like Canada or Western Europe?

2022-04-05 04:37:37,959 - chat_count:1180 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] it's a old GOP fave
2022-04-05 04:37:40,152 - chat_count:1181 [imreallyimportant] [matt_966] Immigration won't even be a blip...the republicans have already showed their hand. It's going to be inflation and gas prices.

2022-04-05 04:38:36,573 - chat_count:5 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] they will go full discrimination issues, inflation is false

2022-04-05 04:53:54,281 - chat_count:129 [imreallyimportant] [Misbashful] Exactly. Any good immigration attorney will be able to force the Administration to discontinue Title 42. It's based on public health conditions.  Blaming Biden is pointless.
2022-04-05 04:54:10,028 - chat_count:130 [imreallyimportant] [ok_armadillo] after researching the current state of the Senate, I think Bidens done a fantastic job trying to strengthen the Dems for these Senate races. think he's truly trying to position for longstanding election security. it's whether Dems can seize the opportunity

2022-04-05 05:01:18,968 - chat_count:245 [imreallyimportant] [otooletime] Sam Seder is way better than Hasan at least
2022-04-05 05:01:19,196 - chat_count:246 [imreallyimportant] [couchman1111] I just let my Hasan sub expire bye daddy azan
2022-04-05 05:01:19,789 - chat_count:247 [imreallyimportant] [twitchdreamsoh] Hasan just lost in the sauce

2022-04-05 05:01:52,395 - chat_count:259 [imreallyimportant] [PotatPowered] given any ballot in the US, you and hasan would probably vote identically, so it's not that crazy to like both
2022-04-05 05:01:53,638 - chat_count:260 [imreallyimportant] [kostonn] Im not a hasan sub but i do tune in to hear his takes since hes one of the biggest on the platform, its always good to know what the other channels are doing/saying

2022-04-05 05:03:59,322 - chat_count:5 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] top ten streamers on Twitch are really not a concern for regular people

2022-04-05 05:04:21,682 - chat_count:11 [imreallyimportant] [dankprole] he's been getting hit for his bad takes recently
2022-04-05 05:04:27,707 - chat_count:12 [imreallyimportant] [ho77iday] He's ultra insecure
2022-04-05 05:04:29,446 - chat_count:13 [imreallyimportant] [wacks_] he does blow up but he reads so many inflammatory comments in chat
2022-04-05 05:04:32,854 - chat_count:14 [imreallyimportant] [hpnotiq115] outrage pays the bills

2022-04-05 05:04:49,599 - chat_count:17 [imreallyimportant] [twitchdreamsoh] Probably easy to focus on negative comments in the chat vs all the love
2022-04-05 05:04:52,698 - chat_count:18 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] he shouldn't have used his dog, it was weird and manipulative imo
2022-04-05 05:04:56,901 - chat_count:19 [imreallyimportant] [couchman1111] @wacks_ he seeks out the inflammatory and controversial takes in chat and in LSF

2022-04-05 05:05:39,369 - chat_count:28 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] My dead dog story is none of anyones dam business

2022-04-05 05:08:49,091 - chat_count:64 [imreallyimportant] [ho77iday] The biggin' up racism because it helps give him content was terrifying.
2022-04-05 05:08:50,882 - chat_count:65 [imreallyimportant] [BKRich] It’s become a job he doesn’t like anymore, doing 6-8hrs of something you don’t love, but it’s funding his lifestyle so he’ll just be annoyed and do fluff videos everyday
2022-04-05 05:08:51,849 - chat_count:66 [imreallyimportant] [twitchdreamsoh] Hasan should have listened to GucciMane
2022-04-05 05:09:01,776 - chat_count:67 [imreallyimportant] [dankprole] didn't gym yeah laundry come from Jersey shore?
2022-04-05 05:09:07,934 - chat_count:68 [imreallyimportant] [Zarroc] America should guarantee their security but not like article 5 or giving them arms like we are now LUL

2022-04-05 05:09:51,320 - chat_count:73 [imreallyimportant] [hpnotiq115] in my defense, I was just starting to get into politics on twitch and he was the first one I found
2022-04-05 05:09:54,262 - chat_count:74 [imreallyimportant] [HyperShpere] I don't think he's in it for the right things. like destiny actually puts his money where his mouth is
2022-04-05 05:10:01,086 - chat_count:75 [imreallyimportant] [couchman1111] Hell yeah

2022-04-05 05:10:38,552 - chat_count:80 [imreallyimportant] [twitchdreamsoh] The way Hasan chews gum says everything about him
2022-04-05 05:10:43,992 - chat_count:81 [imreallyimportant] [Zarroc] @Shadimar I was referring to that being what Hasan said in relation to Ukraine, Who we are giving arms too.

2022-04-06 00:06:58,070 - chat_count:97 [imreallyimportant] [nabor605] yeah but in the speech Zelenskyy kind of said if the UN/Nato doesn't get to work beyond just talking words, then they need to consider restructuring into something better D:
2022-04-06 00:07:38,713 - chat_count:98 [imreallyimportant] [harryj0889] @imreallyimportant do you think we need to reassess the UN/NATO considering how Russia is treating the governing bodies? Do these things work?

2022-04-06 00:29:06,734 - chat_count:222 [imreallyimportant] [sirwelpington] That’s why most politicians don’t touch the space . If you can continue to break the mold imagine the possibilities , your stream is the only one I look forward too and turn into everyday .

2022-04-06 00:35:56,360 - chat_count:281 [imreallyimportant] [couchman1111] Most “culture war” stuff is for people’s entertainment

2022-04-06 00:39:22,740 - chat_count:298 [imreallyimportant] [nabor605] Yeah some pop culture YouTube shows like Friday Night Tights claim they’re welcoming to everyone that’s fans of pop culture content, but they spend half their show badmouthing Biden fans and vaccines nowadays.

2022-04-06 00:50:22,653 - chat_count:391 [imreallyimportant] [couchman1111] ACA is simple to use but it’s still way too expensive

2022-04-06 00:50:29,010 - chat_count:393 [imreallyimportant] [nabor605] I apply for ACA every year. More often than not I end up paying back the premium tax credits on my income tax, but that’s fair

2022-04-06 00:51:09,813 - chat_count:397 [imreallyimportant] [HyperShpere] I don't doubt it.  pregnancy increase risks for other conditions NotLikeThis
2022-04-06 00:51:19,986 - chat_count:398 [imreallyimportant] [nabor605] The pre-existing condition was the best positive change ACA did imo
2022-04-06 00:51:27,015 - chat_count:399 [imreallyimportant] [DesolateMirror] Are they actually announcing healthcare?
2022-04-06 00:51:59,200 - chat_count:400 [imreallyimportant] [ttbro12] If they announce Medicare 4 All... I will take off my shirt and run to the street

2022-04-06 00:52:17,574 - chat_count:404 [imreallyimportant] [ebiker92] it was written by the Heritage Foundation for Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts
2022-04-06 00:52:24,025 - chat_count:405 [imreallyimportant] [couchman1111] @ttbro12 me too, but that’s a giga cope
2022-04-06 00:52:26,164 - chat_count:406 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] Manchin doesn't vote against everything @enigmatikat .
2022-04-06 00:52:31,696 - chat_count:407 [imreallyimportant] [LarryKenobi1138] I remember Republicans saying Obamacare was going to bankrupt America. Still waiting....
2022-04-06 00:52:32,279 - chat_count:408 [imreallyimportant] [Sonicfear] These changes will make ACA available to 120 million more americans.
2022-04-06 00:52:40,323 - chat_count:409 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] In fact Manchin is voting for the Supreme Court justice
2022-04-06 00:52:44,992 - chat_count:410 [imreallyimportant] [ttbro12] @HyperShpere Seriously, that would be huge and a slam dunk for the midterms.
2022-04-06 00:52:45,601 - chat_count:411 [imreallyimportant] [0xGadgetMaker] @ttbro12  my expectations are calibrated for that level of excitement for a public option

2022-04-06 00:53:43,108 - chat_count:414 [imreallyimportant] [nabor605] Biden made some adjustment to it last spring that made my premium tax credit an additional $120
2022-04-06 00:53:45,458 - chat_count:415 [imreallyimportant] [ttbro12] @acreal Man do I HATE Sinema. I mean I don't understand.
2022-04-06 00:53:46,377 - chat_count:416 [imreallyimportant] [enigmatikat] @mahcahwaca seems like something he would vote against. He shut down Sanders over medicare expansion

2022-04-06 00:54:41,821 - chat_count:420 [imreallyimportant] [Sonicfear] ACA is largely popular, I'd expect Manchin would be onboard due to it's popularity. Sinema of course will oppose no matter what.

2022-04-06 02:12:10,499 - chat_count:1629 [imreallyimportant] [aguarama91] hide the screen and play the video
2022-04-06 02:12:17,255 - chat_count:1630 [imreallyimportant] [roygbiv13] no need to risk your channel
2022-04-06 02:12:28,399 - chat_count:1631 [imreallyimportant] [ok_armadillo] the one the UN showed was jarring

2022-04-06 02:14:50,860 - chat_count:1646 [imreallyimportant] [melashingo] @crjak yep. He speaks Russian as well I’m pretty sure
2022-04-06 02:14:52,027 - chat_count:1647 [imreallyimportant] [aguarama91] basically hide the screen when the narrator speaks
2022-04-06 02:15:11,947 - chat_count:1648 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] screw Infrared for even defending this. Saying this is the Ukrainians doing this
2022-04-06 02:15:27,173 - chat_count:1649 [imreallyimportant] [TheMulticulturalistJames] Hey there Iri Oh man yeah this is really heavy
2022-04-06 02:15:28,441 - chat_count:1650 [imreallyimportant] [RarePoPo] ok dood
2022-04-06 02:15:40,254 - chat_count:1651 [imreallyimportant] [BrokenPliers] UN Security Council is a farce while Russia holds a seat on it
2022-04-06 02:15:43,742 - chat_count:1652 [imreallyimportant] [crjak] @melashingo yeah his crimea series in 2014 was top tier journalism
2022-04-06 02:15:57,147 - chat_count:1653 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] Blinken <3
2022-04-06 02:15:59,122 - chat_count:1654 [imreallyimportant] [LizfromMaryland] Peace-keeping mission...
2022-04-06 02:16:02,153 - chat_count:1655 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] the russians should be removed from the security council, they are clearly a kinda weak country compared to what we assumed
2022-04-06 02:16:05,657 - chat_count:1656 [imreallyimportant] [ratchetbug] they were sleeping twitch imreallySweaty
2022-04-06 02:16:21,618 - chat_count:1657 [imreallyimportant] [Sirspork76] Infrared should be banned, if not worse. Russian sympathizers are subhuman monsters
2022-04-06 02:16:38,507 - chat_count:1658 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] an entire nation rotten from the inside by theft
2022-04-06 02:17:00,616 - chat_count:1659 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] on CNN they showed security tags on cans of meat/fish in russian supermarkets
2022-04-06 02:17:03,053 - chat_count:1660 [imreallyimportant] [TheMulticulturalistJames] Dude it's so impressive Ukrainian forces are able to push the Russian military back
2022-04-06 02:17:08,717 - chat_count:1661 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] resupply will take time. It took Russia months to prepare for this. Now they are doing this in war time
2022-04-06 02:17:12,022 - chat_count:1662 [imreallyimportant] [crjak] at this point, enough with the sanctions , its time for tanks, jets and heavy arty
2022-04-06 02:17:17,613 - chat_count:1663 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] Oh, sorry, "special military operation" time
2022-04-06 02:17:30,803 - chat_count:1664 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] Ukraine is getting two of those things
2022-04-06 02:17:44,527 - chat_count:1665 [imreallyimportant] [melashingo] @crjak true. People sh*t on vice now but their journalism in combat zones is still good imo

2022-04-06 02:21:03,549 - chat_count:1679 [imreallyimportant] [Sirspork76] @wasteddesign I was being hyperbolic. My point was is any weapon their heart’s desire should be made available to them.

2022-04-06 02:23:54,386 - chat_count:1689 [imreallyimportant] [generalmart0k] We're at a point I think where we wait and see which atrocity is too much for Europe to stomach and the conflict broadens. We're only going to see more of this.
2022-04-06 02:24:26,156 - chat_count:1690 [imreallyimportant] [SixPinkOneBlue] No but it still needs to be done
2022-04-06 02:24:42,190 - chat_count:1691 [imreallyimportant] [Mobhunter86] the more they lose, the harder the recovery will be. keep hitting.

2022-04-06 02:27:49,673 - chat_count:1700 [imreallyimportant] [q_wolf] @Mobhunter86 but imagine if they did the opposite and backed Russia
2022-04-06 02:27:59,625 - chat_count:1701 [imreallyimportant] [snowymittenz] vote Russia to death. that'll teach em
2022-04-06 02:28:06,791 - chat_count:1702 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] I feel if we do that, we will just have our international body and China/Russia will have theirs
2022-04-06 02:28:30,749 - chat_count:1703 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] Chat can be so annoying sometimes. What the **** you want them to do start WW3?
2022-04-06 02:28:43,693 - chat_count:1704 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] International diplomacy is hard
2022-04-06 02:28:44,085 - chat_count:1705 [imreallyimportant] [Mobhunter86] @q_wolf they couldn't. it would be the end of the UN
2022-04-06 02:28:52,904 - chat_count:1706 [imreallyimportant] [austintatiouslyawkward] @mahcahwaca exactly
2022-04-06 02:28:57,864 - chat_count:1707 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] exactly
2022-04-06 02:29:07,557 - chat_count:1708 [imreallyimportant] [generalmart0k] I used to live in China and have a lot of friends there. All of them are completely against what Russia is doing, thankfully.
2022-04-06 02:29:35,143 - chat_count:1709 [imreallyimportant] [Sleep_Dealer_] @mahcahwaca they're mostly kids, it's easy to say these things if one doesn't understand what war is
2022-04-06 02:29:35,514 - chat_count:1710 [imreallyimportant] [ratkin4] That's not what the question bwas about.
2022-04-06 02:29:54,817 - chat_count:1711 [imreallyimportant] [youknow9527] Neither oppose nor support
2022-04-06 02:30:09,760 - chat_count:1712 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] Seems like everyone is upset but also don't know what they want. If Biden does something, he's careening us to WW3. If he does nothing, he is heartless and foolish.
2022-04-06 02:30:16,243 - chat_count:1713 [imreallyimportant] [Mobhunter86] complacency is support @youknow9527
2022-04-06 02:30:28,945 - chat_count:1714 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] the czechs have sent them tanks
2022-04-06 02:30:33,879 - chat_count:1715 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] GIVEN them tanks no less
2022-04-06 02:30:37,554 - chat_count:1716 [imreallyimportant] [J0nnyclueless] I am not convinced getting involved is WW3 no matter what the involvement is
2022-04-06 02:30:38,037 - chat_count:1717 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] why arent we?
2022-04-06 02:30:47,834 - chat_count:1718 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] Russia obviously despises that the US and the West are supporting Ukraine with weapons. But they wouldn't go to war with it because they would die.
2022-04-06 02:30:56,753 - chat_count:1719 [imreallyimportant] [Blackbaby13] no one says Biden is heartless or foolish besides the far right and people who just want war
2022-04-06 02:30:59,580 - chat_count:1720 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] bingo friday
2022-04-06 02:31:09,332 - chat_count:1721 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] The "vote" commentary is basically saying Biden isn't doing anything, neither are his advisors, I'm a Twitch chatter that's not even following, I know better than all these foreign policy experts @fridaybossman1
2022-04-06 02:31:13,045 - chat_count:1722 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] So they complain, because unless they bumrush the western border to blow off Western aid
2022-04-06 02:31:26,620 - chat_count:1723 [imreallyimportant] [J0nnyclueless] They are trying to keep it contained to Ukraine.
2022-04-06 02:31:31,205 - chat_count:1724 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] russia is a wounded pig, make em weaker while its convenient
2022-04-06 02:31:32,477 - chat_count:1725 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] The aid will keep coming
2022-04-06 02:31:50,953 - chat_count:1726 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] We need to convince Russia that they can't take Ukraine
2022-04-06 02:31:57,634 - chat_count:1727 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] yep
2022-04-06 02:32:07,714 - chat_count:1728 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] And if they don't want it with words, we will show them we will not allow them to take Ukraine
2022-04-06 02:32:15,752 - chat_count:1729 [imreallyimportant] [austintatiouslyawkward] true friday
2022-04-06 02:32:20,223 - chat_count:1730 [imreallyimportant] [ZenShineNine] I think she knows Russia isn't going to do any real negotiating. It's only a stall tactic
2022-04-06 02:32:32,181 - chat_count:1731 [imreallyimportant] [SixPinkOneBlue] yep
2022-04-06 02:32:33,517 - chat_count:1732 [imreallyimportant] [Mobhunter86] yup.
2022-04-06 02:32:48,771 - chat_count:1733 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] Big countries just can't invade smaller countries. And if Russia wants to do that, then other big countries will make them wish they hadn't
2022-04-06 02:32:56,458 - chat_count:1734 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] If any of these issues were easy Biden wouldn't be dealing with them. They would have been dealt with by someone much lower level already. If you think you know, you probably don't, you're just a Twitch chatter
2022-04-06 02:33:11,062 - chat_count:1735 [imreallyimportant] [ZenShineNine] ^^^

2022-04-06 02:33:24,775 - chat_count:1738 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] India spoke out against the deaths in Bucha. This is very much a turning point because now neutral or wiffle-waffling countries have to have an explanation for this
2022-04-06 02:33:34,204 - chat_count:1739 [imreallyimportant] [SixPinkOneBlue] @mahcahwaca yep
2022-04-06 02:33:39,917 - chat_count:1740 [imreallyimportant] [westerndrop3321] The more Russia is delegitimized on the world stage, the better.
2022-04-06 02:33:51,530 - chat_count:1741 [imreallyimportant] [kim_jong_rodman] Israel spoke out too and they've bene trying very hard to nit make Russia mad
2022-04-06 02:34:01,149 - chat_count:1742 [imreallyimportant] [youknow9527] Isn't this the result the US wants? Russia and the European Union lose both

2022-04-06 02:46:13,086 - chat_count:1944 [imreallyimportant] [niamreagan] it’s rlly odd, and turkey is also using weapons from them that nato doesn’t know how to use.

2022-04-06 02:46:47,004 - chat_count:1951 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] Putin's polling went up
2022-04-06 02:46:47,431 - chat_count:1952 [imreallyimportant] [fridaybossman1] Instead, Russia would devolve into a vicious civil war that kills millions, as each faction of the world supports their own side
2022-04-06 02:46:53,447 - chat_count:1953 [imreallyimportant] [niamreagan] @wasteddesign i’m sure ukraine would rather be in nato and then we wouldn’t need turkey
2022-04-06 02:47:03,537 - chat_count:1954 [imreallyimportant] [melashingo] @wasteddesign Turkey is also sponsoring al-queda offshoots in Syria and bombing innocent civilians (predominantly Kurds and Yezidi’s) in Syria and Iraq

2022-04-06 02:49:04,171 - chat_count:1985 [imreallyimportant] [melashingo] @wasteddesign it’s more complex than them being Russian stooges. They’re playing both sides and using that leverage to get away with atrocities domestic and abroad.

2022-04-06 02:55:54,547 - chat_count:2082 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] yep
2022-04-06 02:55:55,900 - chat_count:2083 [imreallyimportant] [HyperShpere] let's save lives by not endangering our soldiers
2022-04-06 02:56:02,869 - chat_count:2084 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] give them tanks and jets
2022-04-06 02:56:08,826 - chat_count:2085 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] they have to take the fight to the east
2022-04-06 02:56:09,029 - chat_count:2086 [imreallyimportant] [MeatHead213] Ukraine is smashing expectations
2022-04-06 02:56:16,935 - chat_count:2087 [imreallyimportant] [sourcingsupport] global conflict with nuclear powers... that'll save lives..
2022-04-06 02:56:18,060 - chat_count:2088 [imreallyimportant] [MeatHead213] keep throwing equipment their way
2022-04-06 02:56:18,126 - chat_count:2089 [imreallyimportant] [acreal] i think the reports out of bucha are getting people really fired up
2022-04-06 02:56:19,896 - chat_count:2090 [imreallyimportant] [stoic_squirrel] Ukraine is asking for our help. If we help, it's not unwanted intervention
2022-04-06 02:56:20,091 - chat_count:2091 [imreallyimportant] [gaylincoln] we need to arm Ukraine EZ
2022-04-06 02:56:25,581 - chat_count:2092 [imreallyimportant] [PayeTrin] well send it hunter
2022-04-06 02:56:28,479 - chat_count:2093 [imreallyimportant] [Mobhunter86] we need to simply keep funding them...
2022-04-06 02:56:29,007 - chat_count:2094 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] until now it was defensive positions mostly but taking back territory needs mobilised armor
2022-04-06 02:56:35,896 - chat_count:2095 [imreallyimportant] [J0nnyclueless] I would provide protection for an evacuation corridor
2022-04-06 02:56:37,255 - chat_count:2096 [imreallyimportant] [nabor605] people forgot the movie "Team American World Police" was a parody/satire of American policy, not a blueprint of what we should be doing

2022-04-06 02:56:46,259 - chat_count:2098 [imreallyimportant] [Mobhunter86] the money wars are actually useful.
2022-04-06 02:56:48,053 - chat_count:2099 [imreallyimportant] [ron1n_] honestly as silly as some of the suggestions are, I'll take some good ol' fashioned america world police talking points over some of the pro-russian/pro-putin thinking that was coming from the right initially
2022-04-06 02:56:48,279 - chat_count:2100 [imreallyimportant] [Sirspork76] Ukrainians need armored vehicles and jets
2022-04-06 02:56:50,879 - chat_count:2101 [imreallyimportant] [TipsyFishes] Any involvement of US/NATO troops would result in a need to invade Russia itself. I.E expanding the conflict. That's the only outcome.
2022-04-06 02:56:56,050 - chat_count:2102 [imreallyimportant] [stoic_squirrel] Intervention would be if we decided to go into Russia and topple Putin
2022-04-06 02:57:15,432 - chat_count:2103 [imreallyimportant] [stoic_squirrel] Helping Ukraine when they're asking for our help is not intervention
2022-04-06 02:57:18,337 - chat_count:2104 [imreallyimportant] [J0nnyclueless] you can't tell me the CIA is not assisting Ukraine in tactics. No way Ukraine strategy is that good on its own
2022-04-06 02:57:27,399 - chat_count:2105 [imreallyimportant] [PayeTrin] this has been planned for like 8 years
2022-04-06 02:57:33,726 - chat_count:2106 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] as far as ive seen so far the only one sending them tanks is the czechs
2022-04-06 02:57:40,775 - chat_count:2107 [imreallyimportant] [stoic_squirrel] @J0nnyclueless It's not a secret that the US has been helping to train Ukrainian troops
2022-04-06 02:57:50,487 - chat_count:2108 [imreallyimportant] [nabor605] those anti-aircraft modules are pretty neat though

2022-04-06 02:58:00,334 - chat_count:2110 [imreallyimportant] [HyperShpere] a stinger missile can be used offensively with some inspiration
2022-04-06 02:58:08,701 - chat_count:2111 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] they NEED it, the only thing that can reasonably be seen as too offensive are medium to long range missiles
2022-04-06 02:58:17,684 - chat_count:2112 [imreallyimportant] [snowymittenz] it's defensive if it's your territory
2022-04-06 02:58:24,644 - chat_count:2113 [imreallyimportant] [Sirspork76] That kind of escalation is nonsensical. Putin will hoot and holler, but he’s a leashed dog.
2022-04-06 02:58:27,231 - chat_count:2114 [imreallyimportant] [nabor605] I wish YouTube TV would carry C-SPAN :(
2022-04-06 02:58:35,487 - chat_count:2115 [imreallyimportant] [TipsyFishes] We're sending them as much as we can. They want Soviet era weapons, and it isn't the US that isn't giving it to them. It's former Warsaw Pact territories
2022-04-06 02:58:39,601 - chat_count:2116 [imreallyimportant] [J0nnyclueless] problem with jets is you need pilots that are trained on those jets

2022-04-06 02:58:50,901 - chat_count:2118 [imreallyimportant] [WastedDesign] nothing else would be useful in attacking russia, except maybe jets. but then russia have land based air defences so i also question whether the ukrainians would use them in russia

2022-04-06 03:07:07,808 - chat_count:2231 [imreallyimportant] [lurkytheactiveposter] Honestly if you want growth in this industry, you need to intertwine real politics with outrage against fringe conservatives and leftists.   The problem is the latter is largely irrelevant to real life.

2022-04-06 03:13:36,921 - chat_count:2310 [imreallyimportant] [GameObject] @mcdrumms twitch is full of "lefties", debating them is a good way to lose viewers
2022-04-06 03:13:37,570 - chat_count:2311 [imreallyimportant] [mahcahwaca] Apparently Sahairah just wrote David an email and said need a mod? Cause he was having some trolls. So email works @imreallyimportant

2022-04-06 03:32:48,950 - chat_count:2581 [imreallyimportant] [4Not_paroL] it was like maybe 1 min
2022-04-06 03:32:50,172 - chat_count:2582 [imreallyimportant] [diet_0] the guy who was banned was on his stream for like 5 minutes
2022-04-06 03:32:51,210 - chat_count:2583 [imreallyimportant] [Sleep_Dealer_] he received an email, it had nothing to do with fuentes
2022-04-06 03:32:54,655 - chat_count:2584 [imreallyimportant] [4Not_paroL] and then he went to youtube
2022-04-06 03:33:00,007 - chat_count:2585 [imreallyimportant] [niamreagan] @imreallyimportant Twitch needs to be transparent, I’m always worried I’m gonna get banned for something someone else got banned for becuz Idk what’s allowed or not allowed.

2022-04-06 03:49:11,723 - chat_count:2845 [imreallyimportant] [HyperShpere] is SCOTUS really gonna do it?
2022-04-06 03:49:18,017 - chat_count:2846 [imreallyimportant] [reachercar] i really hope things calm down w inflation and gas prices by then
2022-04-06 03:49:39,804 - chat_count:2847 [imreallyimportant] [Misbashful] That's whats so hard about our politics. Republicans could spit in their own voter's faces, and still get their vote.

2022-04-06 03:51:02,296 - chat_count:2878 [imreallyimportant] [Astr8lis] There have been some arrests right?
2022-04-06 03:51:20,623 - chat_count:2879 [imreallyimportant] [Sonicfear] I feel like it's more the failing of Garland and DOJ to move on it.
2022-04-06 03:51:28,106 - chat_count:2880 [imreallyimportant] [elove07065] Tarrio too
2022-04-06 03:51:28,336 - chat_count:2881 [imreallyimportant] [rock4571] i was not expecting that call to go that way
2022-04-06 03:51:52,705 - chat_count:2882 [imreallyimportant] [TipsyFishes] Dems have had a net of 27 flipped local seats across Wisconsin as of right now with more coming. @imreallyimportant
2022-04-06 03:51:57,568 - chat_count:2883 [imreallyimportant] [HyperShpere] I don't think so. democrats don't have the guts to charge Republicans

2022-04-06 03:52:15,605 - chat_count:2885 [imreallyimportant] [PayeTrin] hopefully its just as good as the 9/11 commission was
2022-04-06 03:52:45,867 - chat_count:2886 [imreallyimportant] [Sonicfear] Merrick Garland seems to be walking a tightrope between the Dems and the GOP.
2022-04-06 03:52:49,700 - chat_count:2887 [imreallyimportant] [HyperShpere] charging politicians is political though and there's no way democrats want to engage in that battle
2022-04-06 03:52:56,632 - chat_count:2888 [imreallyimportant] [Typ34] there may not be enough evidence to charge people like trump
2022-04-06 03:52:57,024 - chat_count:2889 [imreallyimportant] [diet_0] its better for them to take their time and build a strong case than to charge people with stuff that wont stick as a publicity stunt
2022-04-06 03:52:58,467 - chat_count:2890 [imreallyimportant] [snowymittenz] history is against the dems in the house

2022-04-06 03:53:40,421 - chat_count:2895 [imreallyimportant] [reachercar] trump is dumb af i think he'll at least get barred from running
2022-04-06 03:53:43,055 - chat_count:2896 [imreallyimportant] [niamreagan] @imreallyimportant I hope Trump gets life in prison, NY has to show that tax fraud is unacceptable.

2022-04-06 03:54:15,320 - chat_count:2899 [imreallyimportant] [HyperShpere] it's not about being above the Law. it's more about political will
2022-04-06 03:54:15,813 - chat_count:2900 [imreallyimportant] [girlysound] Was Trump saying 65 seats flipping Republican?

2022-04-06 03:54:35,679 - chat_count:2902 [imreallyimportant] [diet_0] republicans sure aren't making themselves look good for the mid terms
2022-04-06 03:54:39,938 - chat_count:2903 [imreallyimportant] [Misbashful] I almost Trump gets all his crazy candidates through their primary with a win. I don't think many of them are capable of winning a general.
